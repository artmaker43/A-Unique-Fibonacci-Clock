# A-Unique-Fibonacci-Clock in JavaScript
The ONLY one that’s accurate to the Local Time’s Second
All the other ones are only accurate every five minutes My Fibonacci Clock uses Three Stacked Levels: The Top Level for the Hour, The Middle Level for the Minute & The Bottom Level for the Second. The Top Level has a external square as a PM indicator The Middle & Lower Levels each have Four external small squares, each which represent increments of 12: 12, 24, 36, & 48
Once a Fibonacci Rectangle reaches a count of 12, it is cleared, and an appropriate external square is updated.
Once a Fibonacci Rectangle reaches a count of 12 AND its external 48 square is also colored, that complete level is cleared, and the next higher level is updated.
